## [Deep learning helps robots grasp and move objects with ease](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/11/201118141827.htm)

With the current state of the pandemic, it is no surprise that there have been many issues that have since surfaced. Researchers at the University of California have decided to try and mitigate the situation by improving the workings of robots to ensure the safety of warehouse workers. It was interesting to hear their working progress in trying to improve the robot's movement and speed. Personally, I would not have thought of robots as a means to fight the pandemic, but it was an enlightening view towards the goal. However, the article did also make me wonder how many people would favor this idea. Many already fear of loss of jobs with the fast-growing technology, and I am curious how people would percieve this technology once the pandemic is over.

As technology progresses further and further, it is natural to think of how robots will automate tasks and which tasks will be covered. For this reason on its own, this article is very interesting. The idea of automated robots is a very exciting idea, as it is a great way to increase productivity and, as the article mentions, a great way to ensure human worker safety. However, as Michelle touched upon, my first thought reading through the article was the concern of those whose jobs will be taken. It will be interesting how the pros and cons of this development will balance.
