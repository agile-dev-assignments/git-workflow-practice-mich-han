With the current state of the pandemic, it is no surprise that there have been many issues that have since surfaced. Researchers at the University of California have decided to try and mitigate the situation by improving the workings of robots to ensure the safety of warehouse workers. It was interesting to hear their working progress in trying to improve the robot's movement and speed. Personally, I would not have thought of robots as a means to fight the pandemic, but it was an enlightening view towards the goal. However, the article did also make me wonder how many people would favor this idea. Many already fear of loss of jobs with the fast-growing technology, and I am curious how people would percieve this technology once the pandemic is over.
